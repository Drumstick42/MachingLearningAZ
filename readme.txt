This follows my progress of the machine learning A-Z Udemy course. Contains the completed jupyter notebooks, as well as any relevant notes.

Only doing Python, although the course also offers R tutorials.

This is only completed from Polynomial Regression and onward. I lost the notebooks/notes for the earlier lessons. I'll add them if I can ever find them again.
